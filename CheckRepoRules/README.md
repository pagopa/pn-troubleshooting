# GitHub Repository Analyzer Script

## üìù Overview

This script is a command-line tool designed to analyze a list of GitHub repositories. It checks each repository for specific branch protection rules on the `main` and `develop` branches.

The script reads its list of target repositories from a central JSON configuration file located in a separate GitHub repository. After execution, it generates detailed reports identifying repositories that are empty, unprotected, or have specific security rules missing.
